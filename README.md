# TABGMods
A collection of mods I made to TABG (These dont work online, stop looking for hacks)

Instructions:
  Download whatever you are interested in, locate your TotallyAccurateBattlegrounds folder, go to the Data folder within that one,
  go to Managed, replace the original games Assembly-CSharp.dll with my modded one (consider renaming the original to quickly           change between modded and original by renaming the files.
  

  Item spawning mod features:
    
    Press T to spawn in all items in the game. If your PC is very weak, maybe dont do this too much.\
    
    Press C to spawn in all cars in the game. (of course try to be sensible about the amount)
    
    Press P to create a platform below your feet for that sweet drive testing. I might add more interesting things to drive on    soon.
